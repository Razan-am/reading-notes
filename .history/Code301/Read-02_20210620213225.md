## **React lifecycle**

### ***Based off the diagram, what happens first, the `render` or the `componentDidMount`?***


- The `render` comes first when an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM it occurs during the mounting phase.

### ***What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React?***

- In the lifecycle of React the first thing that happened is the **Mounting**,which includes these methods that are called in the following order when an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM:

   - constructor()
   - static getDerivedStateFromProps()
    - render()
    - componentDidMount().

### ***Put the following things in the order that they happen: `componentDidMount`, `render`, `constructor`, `componentWillUnmount`, `React Updates`:***

- The order for the previous methods is:
   - constructor
   - render
   - componentDidMount
   - React Updates
   - componentWillUnmount
 

### ***What does componentDidMount do?***

- `componentDidMount()` is a hook that gets invoked right after a React component has been mounted aka after the first `render()` lifecycle.
