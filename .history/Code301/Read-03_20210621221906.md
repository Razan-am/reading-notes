### ***What does .map() return?***

- It's returned the result to the variable it has been assigned to.

>Example:

`const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];`

`const doubled = numbers.map((number) => number * 2);`

`console.log(doubled);`

>In the example above we use the `map()` function to take an array of numbers and double their values. We assign the new array returned by `map()` to the variable doubled and log it.

### ***If I want to loop through an array and display each value iSX, how do I do that in React?***

- We can build collections of elements and include them in `JSX` using `curly braces {}`.And we loop through them by using the JavaScript `map()` function.Which will return an `html element` for each time, and we assign the resulting array of elements to the `variable` we have declare it.

>Example:

`const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];`

`const listItems = numbers.map((number) =>`

 `<li>{number}</li>`

`);`

>Below, we loop through the numbers array using the `map() function`. We return a `<li>` element for each item. Finally, we assign the resulting array of elements to `listItems`.

----

### ***Each list item needs a unique ____.***

- `key` wich is a special string attribute you need to include when creating lists of elements.

>Example:

`const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];`

`const listItems = numbers.map((number) =>`

  `<li key={number.toString()}>`

`{number}`

  `</li>`

`);`

---

### ***What is the purpose of a key?***

- `Keys` help `React` identify which items have `changed, are added, or are removed`, and it should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity.
