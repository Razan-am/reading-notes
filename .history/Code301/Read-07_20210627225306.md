A worker today might start the morning by collaborating with a team of engineers, then send emails to colleagues marketing a new brand, then jump on a conference call planning an entirely different product line, while also juggling team meetings with accounting and the party-planning committee. 
- Every day, the  teammates gathered to discuss homework assignments, compare spreadsheets and strategize for exams. Everyone was smart and curious, and they had a lot in common. These shared experiences, would make it easy for them to work well together. 

- Today, on corporate campuses and within university laboratories, psychologists, sociologists and statisticians are devoting themselves to studying everything from team composition to email patterns in order to figure out how to make employees into faster, better and more productive versions of themselves.

-  `Google’s People Operations` department has scrutinized everything from how frequently particular people eat together `(the most productive employees tend to build larger networks by rotating dining companions)` to which traits the best managers share `(unsurprisingly, good communication and avoiding micromanaging is critical; more shocking, this was news to many Google managers)`.

- The technology industry is not just one of the fastest growing parts of our economy; it is also increasingly the world’s dominant commercial culture.

- `Employee performance optimization` movement has given us a method for talking about our insecurities, fears and aspirations in more constructive ways. It also has given us the tools to quickly teach lessons that once took managers decades to absorb.
