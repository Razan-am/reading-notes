- They make a programs, a way for students to practice working in teams and a reflection of the increasing demand for employees who can adroitly navigate group dynamics. A worker today might start the morning by collaborating with a team of engineers, then send emails to colleagues marketing a new brand, then jump on a conference call planning an entirely different product line, while also juggling team meetings with accounting and the party-planning committee. 
- Every day, the  teammates gathered to discuss homework assignments, compare spreadsheets and strategize for exams. Everyone was smart and curious, and they had a lot in common. These shared experiences, would make it easy for them to work well together. 

- Today, on corporate campuses and within university laboratories, psychologists, sociologists and statisticians are devoting themselves to studying everything from team composition to email patterns in order to figure out how to make employees into faster, better and more productive versions of themselves.

- `THE WORK ISSUE`: 
1. How to Build a Perfect Team
2. The War on Meetings
3. The Case for Blind Hiring
4. Failure to Lunch
5. The 'Good Jobs' Gamble
6. Rethinking the Work-Life Equation
7. The Rise of White-Collar Automation

- `Software engineers` are encouraged to work together, in part because studies show that groups tend to innovate faster, see mistakes more quickly and find better solutions to problems. 

>Studies also show that people working in teams tend to achieve better results and report higher job satisfaction. 

-  `Google’s People Operations` department has scrutinized everything from how frequently particular people eat together `(the most productive employees tend to build larger networks by rotating dining companions)` to which traits the best managers share `(unsurprisingly, good communication and avoiding micromanaging is critical; more shocking, this was news to many Google managers)`.

- The technology industry is not just one of the fastest growing parts of our economy; it is also increasingly the world’s dominant commercial culture. 

- `Google’s` intense data collection and number crunching have led it to the same conclusions that good managers have always known. In the best teams, members listen to one another and show sensitivity to feelings and needs.

- `Employee performance optimization` movement has given us a method for talking about our insecurities, fears and aspirations in more constructive ways. It also has given us the tools to quickly teach lessons that once took managers decades to absorb.

### ***Who is Roy Fielding?***

- He helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet,and he did a research explaining why the web works the way it does. 

### ***Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?***

- Machines don't have a universal nouns,and every programming language, database, or other kind of system has a different way of talking about nouns. That's why the URL is so important. It let's all of these systems tell each other about each other's nouns.

### ***What is the `HTTP` protocol that Fielding and his friends created?***

- it's all about applying verbs to nouns,like  when you go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you typed in and back comes a web page.

What does a `GET` do?

- It's using the HTTP protocol on them until all the resources are obtained and the web page is displayed. `it's used to request data from a specified resource.`

What does a `POST` do?

- It's used If one system needs to add something to another system.

What does `PUT` do?

- It's used If a system wants to replace something in another system

What does `PATCH` do?

- It's used if a system want to do a partial update
