### ***How many `calls` can happen at once?***

- It's  is done, one at a time, from top to bottom. It means the call stack is synchronous.

### ***What does LIFO mean?***

- It's stand for the principle of `Last In, First Out`, which it means that the last function that gets pushed into the stack is the first to be pop out, when the function returns.

### ***Draw an example of a call stack and the functions that would need to be invoked to generate that call stack.***
