### ***Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:***

1. `SQL databases` are primarily called as Relational Databases `RDBMS`,whereas `NoSQL database` are primarily called as `non-relational or distributed database`.

2.` SQL databases` are table based databases whereas `NoSQL databases` are document based.
3. `SQL databases` have predefined schema whereas `NoSQL databases` have dynamic schema for unstructured data.
4. `SQL databases` are vertically scalable whereas the `NoSQL databases` are horizontally scalable.
5. `SQL` database examples: `MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL`. `NoSQL` database examples: `MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j and CouchDb`.
 	 	 
### ***What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?***

-  MySQL Community Edition

***Give a real world example.***

- `MySql` is available for all major platforms like `Linux, Windows, Mac, BSD and Solaris`. It also has connectors to languages like `Node.js, Ruby, C#, C++, C, Java, Perl, PHP and Python`.

### ***What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?***

- MongoDB

***Give a real world example.***

- `Speed: For simple queries, it gives good performance`.
- `Scalability: It is horizontally scalable i.e. you can reduce the workload by increasing the number of servers`.
- `Manageable: It is easy to use for both developers and administrators`. 

### ***Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?***

- Document based database like `MongoDB`, are great for small scale, hierarchical data with a relatively small amount of children for each entry. 

### ***Which type of database is best for scalabilit***
 
- `MongoDB`  it is horizontally scalable i.e. you can reduce the workload by increasing the number of servers in your resource pool instead of relying on a stand alone resource.
