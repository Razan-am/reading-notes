### ***What is node.js?***

- It's a JavaScript runtime built on `Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine`.

### ***In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?***

-  it's open source  with high-performance JavaScript and engine, that  is used in Chrome and in `Node.js`. It's responsible for compiling `JavaScript` directly to native machine code that your computer can execute.

### ***What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?***

- It's runtime environment that achieves low latency and high throughput by taking a non-blocking approach to serving requests, it's wastes no time or resources on waiting for the requests to return.

### ***What is npm?***

-   It's a package manager that comes bundled with the `Node.js`, it's also the world’s largest software registry.

### ***What version of node are you running on your machine?***

- It's `v12.22.1`.


### ***What version of npm are you running on your machine?***

## **6 Reasons for Pair Programming**

### ***What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?***

1. **Greater efficiency**
2. **Engaged collaboration**
3. **Learning from fellow students**
4. **Social skills**
5. **Job interview readiness**
6. **Work environment readiness**

### ***In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?***

-  For me i see the most benefit of the pair programming is the grater efficiency and the engaged collabration and the learning from fellow students, because i believe that two mind work completly different from only one so while working on pair programming the way we solve the problems is different we think together and discuss the code toogether and that add to us new things that we catch it from each other. And it's make the work more fun and exciting.

### ***How does pair programming work?***

- It's  work by two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator,reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.
