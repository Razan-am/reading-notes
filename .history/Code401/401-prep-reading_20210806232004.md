## **Solving Problems**


### ***Common mistakes when start solving problems***
 - You really want to make sure you take enough time to understand the problem completely before attempting to solve it. No to start writing code as soon as possible.
- Another big mistake is trying to over solve the solution on the first iteration. Keep it simple, don’t try to get fancy.

### ***A simple set of steps to follow***
1. Read the problem completely twice.

>You want to make sure you completely understand the problem, a good test of this is whether or not you can explain the problem to someone else.

2. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.

>It’s very important that when you solve a problem manually, you recognize what your brain is actually doing to solve the problem. 

3. Optimize the manual steps.

>For this step you want to do here is figure out if there is another way you can solve the problem easier, or if there are some steps you can cut our or simplify.

4. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.

>Here you want to do here is capture all the steps we created and now either put them into our editor as comments or write them as psuedo-code that we can translate to real code.

5. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.

>All we do here is take each comment and convert it into a real line of code.

6. Optimize the real code.

>It's to make sure all your variables are named with long meaningful names.
