## **Express REST API**

### ***Name 3 real world use cases where you’d want to change the request with custom middleware***
1. Handling errors
2. Adding query params
3. Make changes to the request and the response objects.

### ***True or false: The route handler is middleware?***

-  False

### ***In what ways can a middleware function end the process and send data to the browser?***

- middleware functions that return a Promise will call `next(value)` when they reject or throw an error, `next` will be called with either the `rejected value` or the thrown `Error`.

### ***At what point in the request lifecycle can you “inject” middleware?***

- For injecting we will need to create the `request`, and create a `middleware` component that actually injects when making the `request`

### ***What can cause express to error with “Request headers sent twice, cannot start a second response”***

- It's means that you're already in the Body or Finished state, but some function tried to set a header or statusCode. When you see this error, try to look for anything that tries to send a header after some of the body has already been written.
