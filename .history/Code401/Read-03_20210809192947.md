## **Express REST API**

### ***Name 3 real world use cases where you’d want to change the request with custom middleware***
1. Handling errors
2. Adding query params
3. Make changes to the request and the response objects.

### ***True or false: The route handler is middleware?***

-  False

### ***In what ways can a middleware function end the process and send data to the browser?***

- middleware functions that return a Promise will call `next(value)` when they reject or throw an error, `next` will be called with either the `rejected value` or the thrown `Error`.

### ***At what point in the request lifecycle can you “inject” middleware?***

- For injecting we will need to create the `request`, and create a `middleware` component that actually injects when making the `request`

### ***What can cause express to error with “Request headers sent twice, cannot start a second response”***

- It's means that you're already in the Body or Finished state, but some function tried to set a header or statusCode. When you see this error, try to look for anything that tries to send a header after some of the body has already been written.

### Document the following Vocabulary Terms


### **Term**
 - **Middleware**: are functions that have access to the request object `req`, the response object `res`, and the next middleware function in the application’s request-response cycle. The next middleware function is commonly denoted by a variable named `next`.
- **Request Object**: is the main entry point for an application to issue a request to the Library - all operations on a URL must use a Request object. 
- **Response Object**:  It is the object which communicates between the server and the output which is sent to the client. 
- **Application Middleware**: is software that lies between an operating system and the applications running on it. Essentially functioning as hidden translation layer, middleware enables communication and data management for distributed applications.
- **Routing Middleware**: It's means that the middleware functions can perform the following tasks:Execute any code,Make changes to the request and the response objects.
- **Test Driven Development**: is a software development process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed,
- **Behavioral Testing**: is a structured study and analysis of a person’s behavior using various methods like interviews, direct supervision, and self-observation.
