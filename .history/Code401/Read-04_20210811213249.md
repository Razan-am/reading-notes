## **Data Modeling**

### ***Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development***

1. Writing the tests first requires you to really consider what do you want from the code.
2. You receive fast feedback.
3. TDD creates a detailed specification.
4. TDD reduces time spent on rework.
5. You spend less time in the debugger.

### ***In what case would you need to use `beforeEach()` or `afterEach()` in a test suite?***

1. removes the explicit calls from the tests themselves. 
2. invites inexperienced users to share state between tests.

### ***What is one downside of Test Driven Development***

-  `TDD` is that the tests need to be maintained because the code has got to. Whenever requirements change, you would like to vary the code and tests.And when writing code that apparently takes an extended time.

### ***What’s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?***

- ES6 class constructors creates objects by adding function to their prototypes `Blueprint`.
- Constructor/Prototype Classes are function constructors also create objects along with inheritance property. 

### ***Why REST?***

1.  REST is Easy to Understand and Implement
2. REST Makes your Application More Scalable:
   - No State
   - Faster Data Interchange Format
3. Caching is Easier with REST
4. REST is Flexibile
