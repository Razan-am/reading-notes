## **Data Modeling**

### ***Explain what a `Singleton` is in Computer Science terms***

- A singleton is a class that allows only a single instance of itself to be created and gives access to that created instance. It contains static variables that can accommodate unique and private instances of itself.

### ***Explain how the `Singleton` pattern can be used with `Node modules`, specifically with classes***

- The singleton pattern is used in programming languages such as Java and .NET to define a global variable.
- Creating singleton in `Node.JS` is very easy. When we take advantage of `Node.JS` caching then this is trivial. In this article we showed two ways of achieving the same results and I strongly recommend to use the latter one.

### ***If you were tasked with building a middleware system like Express uses, what approach might you take to construct/operate it?***

- Bind application-level middleware to an instance of the app object by using the `app.use()` and `app.METHOD()` functions, where METHOD is the HTTP method of the request that the middleware function handles `such as GET, PUT, or POST` in lowercase.
