### ***What can you do with an authorization code?***

- It's is an alphanumeric password that authorizes its user to purchase, sell or transfer items, or to enter information into a security-protected space.

### ***What can you do with an access token?***

- Access tokens are the thing that applications use to make API requests on behalf of a user. The access token represents the authorization of a specific application to access specific parts of a user’s data.
- Access tokens must be kept confidential in transit and in storage.

### ***What’s a benefit of using OAuth instead of your own basic authentication?***

- It enables apps to obtain limited access (scopes) to a user’s data without giving away a user’s password. It decouples authentication from authorization and supports multiple use cases addressing different device capabilities. It supports server-to-server apps, browser-based apps, mobile/native apps, and consoles/TVs.
