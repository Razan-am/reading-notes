## ** Authorization/Authentication**

### ***What header(s) are used in authentication and authorization***

1. **Basic Auth**: Authorization header that contains the word Basic, followed by a space and a base64-encoded(non-encrypted) string username: password.

>Authorization: Basic AXVubzpwQDU1dzByYM==
> Base64 encoding does not mean encryption or hashing!

2. **Bearer Token**: `Bearer Authentication` gives access to the bearer of this token.

>Authorization: Bearer <token>

3. **API Key**: API key auth, you send a key-value pair to the API either in the request headers or query parameters.

>GET /endpoint?api_key=abcdefgh123456789

4. **Digest Auth**:Digest Authentication communicates credentials in an `encrypted form` by applying a `hash algorithm` to the username and the password, the password is converted to response and then it is sent to the server. 

>Authorization: Digest username=”admin” Realm=”abcxyz” nonce=”474754847743646”, uri=”/uri” response=”7cffhfr54685gnnfgerg8”

   - Digest Auth steps:
       1. Client sends a request to the server
        2. The server responds with a special code `called a nonce i.e. number used only once`, another string representing the realm `a hash` for authentication from the client.
      3. The client responds with this nonce and an encrypted version of the username, password, and realm `a hash`
      4. If the `Client hash` matches the `server hash`, the server will respond with the requested information. Otherwise, it will pass an error message.

5. **OAuth 2.0**: you first retrieve an access token for the API, then use that token to authenticate future requests.

>Authorization: Bearer hY_9.B5f-4.1BfE
//where “hY_9.B5f-4.1BfE” is your OAuth Access Token

   - An OAuth 2.0 flow works as follows:
      1. A client application makes a request for the user to authorize access to their data.
     2. the user grants access, the application then requests an `access token` from the `service provider`, passing the access grant from the user and `authentication details to identify the client`.
     3. The service provider validates these details and returns an `access token`. 
     4. The client uses the `access token` to request the user data via the service provider.

6. **Hawk Authentication**: Hawk authentication enables you to authorize requests using partial cryptographic verification.

>Authorization: Hawk id="abcxyz123", ts="1592459563", nonce="gWqbkw", mac="vxBCccCutXGV30gwEDKu1NDXSeqwfq7Z0sg/HP1HjOU="

   - The Hawk Authentication parameters are as follows:
         1. **Hawk Auth ID**: Your API authentication ID value.
         2. **Hawk Auth Key**: Your API authentication key value.
         3. **Algorithm**: The hash algorithm`sha266, sha1` used to create the message authentication code`MAC`.

7. **AWS Signature**: AWS is the authorization workflow for Amazon Web Services requests. AWS uses a custom HTTP scheme based on a keyed-HMAC `Hash Message Authentication Code` for authentication.

>Authorization: AWS4-HMAC-SHA256 Credential=abc/20200618/us-east-1/execute-api/aws4_request, SignedHeaders=host;x-amz-date, Signature=c6c85d0eb7b56076609570f4dbdf730d0a017208d964c615253924149ce65de5

   - The AWS Authentication parameters are as follows:
      1. **Access Key**: API Access key value.
       2. **Secret Key**: API Secret key value.


### ***What is safe to put into a JWT***

1. Registered Claims:
      - `subject`: identifies the principal that is the subject of the JWT. Must be unique
     - `expiration time`: identifies the expiration time after which you must no longer accept this token. 
2. Public claims:
      - with public names or names registered which contain values that should be unique like `email, address or phone_number`
3. Private claims to use in your own context and values can collision

### ***How are JWTs validate***

- the server validates the username and password combination and creates a JWT token with a payload containing the user technical identifier and an expiration timestamp.
