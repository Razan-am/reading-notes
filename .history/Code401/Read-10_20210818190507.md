## **Stacks and Queues**

### ***What is a Stack***

- A stack is a data structure that consists of `Nodes`. Each `Node` references the `next Node` in the `stack`, but does not reference its previous.

### ***Common terminology for a stack***

1. **Push**: Nodes or items that are put into the stack are pushed
2. **Pop**: Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped. When you attempt to pop an empty stack an exception will be raised.
3. **Top**: This is the top of the stack.
4. **Peek**: When you peek you will view the value of the top Node in the stack. When you attempt to peek an empty stack an exception will be raised.
5. **IsEmpty**: returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false.

### ***Stacks follow these concepts***

- **FILO**: `First In Last Out`,this means that the first item added in the stack will be the last item popped out of the stack.
- **LIFO**: `Last In First Out`,this means that the last item added to the stack will be the first item popped out of the stack.

### ***Stack Visualization***

>example of what a stack looks like:

-  As you can see, the topmost item is denoted as the `top`. When you `push` something `to the stack`, it becomes the `new top`. When you `pop` something `from the stack`, you `pop` the `current top` and set the `next top` as `top.next`.

### ***Push O(1)***

- Pushing a Node onto a stack will always be an `O(1)` operation. This is because it takes `the same amount of time` no matter how many `Nodes (n)` you have in the stack.

- When `adding a Node`, you `push` it into the stack by assigning it as the `new top`, with its next property equal to the original top.

### ***How push work***

1. First, you should have the Node that you want to add. 
2. Next, you need to assign the `next property` of the added Node to reference the same Node that top is referencing
3. Your new Node is added to your stack, but there is no indication that it is the first Node in the stack. To make this happen, you have to re-assign our reference top to the newly added Node.
4. Now it's completed a successfully push of the new Node onto the stack.

>Here is the pseudocode to push a value onto a stack:

`ALOGORITHM push(value)`

`// INPUT <-- value to add, wrapped in Node internally`

`// OUTPUT <-- none`

   `node = new Node(value)`

   `node.next <-- Top`

   `top <-- Node`


### ***Pop O(1)***

- `Popping a Node` off a stack is the `action of removing a Node from the top`. When conducting a pop, the top Node will be re-assigned to the Node that lives below and the top Node is returned to the user.

- You would check `isEmpty` before conducting a `pop`. 

### ***How pup work***

1. The first step of removing the `Node` from the stack is to create a reference named `temp` that points to the `same Node` that `top` points to. 
2. Once you have created the new reference type, you now need to `re-assign top` to the value that the `next property` is referencing.
3. We can now remove the `Node` safely without it affecting the rest of the stack.Before we do that though you may want to make sure that you clear out the `next property` in your current temp reference.
4. Return the value of the `temp Node` that was just popped off.

>Here is the pseudocode for a pop

`ALGORITHM pop()`

`// INPUT <-- No input`

`// OUTPUT <-- value of top Node in stack`

`// EXCEPTION if stack is empty`

   `Node temp <-- top`

   `top <-- top.next`

   `temp.next <-- null`

   `return temp.value`


### ***Peek O(1)***

- When conducting a `peek`, you will only be inspecting the top Node of the stac

-  You would check `isEmpty` before conducting a `peek`. This will ensure that an exception is not raised. Alternately, you can wrap the call in a try/catch block.

>Here is the pseudocode for a peek

`ALGORITHM peek()`

`// INPUT <-- none`

`// OUTPUT <-- value of top Node in stack`

`// EXCEPTION if stack is empty`

   `return top.value`

### ***IsEmpty O(1)***

>Here is the pseudocode for isEmpty

`ALGORITHM isEmpty()`

`// INPUT <-- none`

`// OUTPUT <-- boolean`

`return top = NULL`
