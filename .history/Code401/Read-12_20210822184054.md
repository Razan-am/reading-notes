### ***What is the benefit of transforming data into packets?***

- `TDM`-based networks must transform into `packet-based networks` to meet the demands of pervasive data-centric applications and services.

- `Packet-based` networks not only enable `new innovations, services, and business opportunities`, they are also the most `cost-effective, efficient, and scalable networks` for content delivery.

### ***UDP is often refereed to as a connectionless protocol. Why is this?***

- Because it is analogous to sending a letter where you don't acknowledge receipt.

### ***Can a socket server application have multiple socket connections?***

- Yes, Multiple connections on the same server can share the same `server-side IP/Port` pair as long as they are associated with different `client-side IP/Port` pairs, and the server would be able to handle as many clients as available system resources allow it to.

### ***Can a socket connection application be connected to multiple socket servers?***

-  No,a server socket listens on a single port. All established client connections on that server are associated with that same listening port on the server side of the connection.

### ***Can an application be both a socket server and a socket connection?***

- No, You can not combine server and client sockets into one, because a TCP/IP connection goes from a source port to a destination port, with each having unique port numbers.
