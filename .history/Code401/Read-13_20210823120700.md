## **Message Queues**

### ***What does it mean that web sockets are bidirectional? Why is this useful?***

- WebSockets allow for full-duplex bidirectional communication, this enables the server to send real-time updates asynchronously, without requiring the client to submit a request each time. Yes it's useful.

### ***Does socket.io use HTTP? Why?***

- Yes it's use it but it doesn't need an HTTP server to regular websockets,but it is used to allow HTTP and websocket servers to co-exist on the same TCP port.

### ***What happens when a client emits an event?***

- The event gets passed to the server through websockets. Its a tcp connection from the client to the server. The connection meaning the server can send real time data to the client and vise versa.

### ***What happens when a server emits an event?***

- It will send an event called message to the client, after the client connects. The send function on socket object associates the 'message' event.

### ***What happens if a client “misses” an event?***

- The events will be ignored 

### ***How can we mitigate this?***
 
- You could avoid missing messages by always having the handlers  and then deciding in the handlers whether to do anything with the message or not.
