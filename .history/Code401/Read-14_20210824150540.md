## **Event Driven Architecture**

### ***What’s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?***

- `Standard queue` tries to preserve the order of messages (best-effort), but there is a possibility of a message being delivered out of order.

- `FIFO queue`, messages are grouped into `Message groups` and all messages within a message group are sent and received in strict order.

### ***How can the server be assured a message was properly received?***

- By storing the messages at the message queue until the client is confirmed that the message was received, then delete it .

### ***What classic design pattern is best represented by event driven programming?***

1. **Consume and Project**: this pattern can help when you have a bottleneck legacy service that stores “popular” data of large domain objects.
2. **Event-driven from end to end**: the request-reply model is especially common in browser-server interactions.


### ***How do you test an event driven system?***

- Arrange — Setup prerequisites for the test.

- Act — Hit the trigger point to produce the event by microservice.

- Assert — Assert the event produced by microservice against the contract of its consumer.

## **Terms**

- **FIFO Queue**: `FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queues` are designed to enhance messaging between applications when the order of operations and events is critical, or where duplicates can't be tolerated. 


- **Pub/Sub**: `Pub/Sub` allows services to communicate asynchronously, with latencies on the order of 100 milliseconds, and enables you to create systems of event producers and consumers, called publishers and subscribers. `Publishers` communicate with `subscribers` asynchronously by broadcasting events, rather than by synchronous remote procedure calls (RPCs).


-----------------------------------------------

### ***SNS vs SQS Comparison***

- **SNS**: `Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS)` is a managed service that provides message delivery from `publishers to subscribers` (also known as `producers and consumers`). `Publishers` communicate asynchronously with subscribers by sending messages to a topic, which is a logical access point and communication channel. `Clients` can subscribe to the SNS topic and receive published messages using a `supported endpoint` type, such as `Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose, Amazon SQS, AWS Lambda, HTTP, email, mobile push notifications, and mobile text messages (SMS)`.

- **SQS**: `Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS)` is a fully managed message queuing service that enables you to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications. `SQS` eliminates the complexity and overhead associated with managing and operating message-oriented middleware, and empowers developers to focus on differentiating work. Using `SQS`, you can `send, store, and receive messages` between software components at any volume, without losing messages or requiring other services to be available.
