## **Trees**

- There is different types of trees such as `Binary Trees`, `Binary Search Trees`, and `K-ary Trees`.

### ***Common Terminology***
- **Node** - A Tree node is a component which may contain it’s own values, and references to other nodes
- **Root** - The root is the node at the beginning of the tree
- **K** - A number that specifies the `maximum number` of children any node may have in a `k-ary tree`. In a `binary tree, k = 2`.
- **Left** - A reference to `one child node`, in a `binary tree`
- **Right** - A reference to the `other child node`, in a `binary tree`
- **Edge** - The edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node
- **Leaf** - A leaf is a node that does not have any children
- **Height** - The height of a tree is the number of edges from the root to the furthest leaf


### ***Traversals***
- An important aspect of trees is how to traverse them. Traversing a tree allows us to search for a node, print out the contents of a tree, and much more! 
- There are two categories of traversals when it comes to trees:

  1. Depth First
  2. Breadth First

- **Depth First**
  - Depth first traversal is where we prioritize going through the depth (height) of the tree first.there are multiple ways to carry out depth first traversal, and each method changes the order in which we search/print the root. 
- Here are three methods for depth first traversal:
   1. **Pre-order**: root >> left >> right
   2. **In-order**: left >> root >> right
   3. **Post-order**: left >> right >> root

>Example:

![image1]()
- If we have this sample of tree , the traversals would result in different paths:

- Pre-order: A, B, D, E, C, F
- In-order: D, B, E, A, F, C
- Post-order: D, E, B, F, C, A


- **Pre-order**

- Pre-order means that the `root` has to be looked at `first`. When we call preOrder for the first time, the `root` will be added to the call stack. we start reading our preOrder function’s code from top to bottom. This means that we will output the root.value out to the console.And it will start check the left of the root then when it's finished it will check the right of the root.

>Ehwn the root.left and root.right will return null the next node will act as the root  to continue execution

> Here is the pseudocode for this traversal method:

- **In-order**

> Here is the pseudocode for this traversal method:

![inorder]()

- **post-order**

> Here is the pseudocode for this traversal method:

![postorder]()


>The previous tree traversals are similar but the difference between each of the traversals is when you are looking at the `root node`.
