## **AWS: Cloud Servers**

### ***Describe the Web-Request-Response-Cycle***

- First a `user` gives a `client` a URL, the `client` builds a `request` for information or resources to be generated by a `server`. When the `server receives that request`, it uses the information included in the request to build a `response` that contains the `requested information`. Once built, that response is `sent back` to the client in the requested format, to be rendered to the user.

### ***Explain what a `server` is, as it relates to the WRRC***

- A server is a computer program or device that provides a service to another computer program and its user, also known as the client. 
- A server program awaits and fulfills requests from client programs, which might be running in the same, or other computers. A given application in a computer might function as a client with requests for services from other programs and as a server of requests from other programs.

### ***What does it mean to `deploy` an application?***

- It is the process of `installing, configuring, and enabling` a specific application or set of applications, usually through an application manager `app manager` or software management system, to a specific URL on a server.
