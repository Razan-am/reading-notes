## **AWS: S3 and Lambda**

### ***Describe “The Cloud”***

- `The cloud` refers to servers that are accessed over the Internet, and the software and databases that run on those servers. 

### ***What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)?***

- `Containers` are a solution to the problem of how to get software to run reliably when moved from one computing environment to another. 

### ***What is auto-scaling?*** 

- `AWS Auto Scaling` monitors your applications and automatically adjusts capacity to maintain steady, predictable performance at the lowest possible cost.

### ***What is bandwidth?*** 

- It's meaning the maximum amount of data transmitted over an internet connection in a given amount of time. 

### ***How do cloud providers compute service costs?***

- Cloud providers determine the expense to maintaining the network. They start by calculating costs for `network hardware`, `network infrastructure maintenance`, and `labor`. These expenses are added together and then divided by the number of rack units a business will need for its IaaS cloud
