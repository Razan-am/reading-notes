## **AWS: S3 and Lambda**

### ***Describe “The Cloud”***

- `The cloud` refers to servers that are accessed over the Internet, and the software and databases that run on those servers. 

### ***What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)?***

- `Containers` are a solution to the problem of how to get software to run reliably when moved from one computing environment to another. 

### ***What is auto-scaling?*** 

- `AWS Auto Scaling` monitors your applications and automatically adjusts capacity to maintain steady, predictable performance at the lowest possible cost.

### ***What is bandwidth?*** 

- It's meaning the maximum amount of data transmitted over an internet connection in a given amount of time. 

### ***How do cloud providers compute service costs?***

- Cloud providers determine the expense to maintaining the network. They start by calculating costs for `network hardware`, `network infrastructure maintenance`, and `labor`. These expenses are added together and then divided by the number of rack units a business will need for its IaaS cloud

## **Terms**



- **Server Instances**: it's a collection of `SQL Server databases` which are run by a solitary SQL Server service or instance. 

- **Containers**: is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.

- **Cloud Services**: it's refers to a wide range of services delivered on demand to companies and customers over the internet. 

- **Cloud Architecture**:  is how individual technologies are integrated to create clouds—IT environments that abstract, pool, and share scalable resources across a network.

- **AWS**: `Amazon Web Services (AWS)` is the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform, offering over 200 fully featured services from data centers globally. 

- **EC2/Beanstalk vs Heroku**:
  - `Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)` is an Infrastructure as a Service product, and is Amazon’s flagship offering. Before we’re able to deploy an application on Elastic Compute Cloud, we have to develop server infrastructure that will suit our application.
   - `Heroku is a Platform as a Service` (PaaS) product based on AWS, and is vastly different from Elastic Compute Cloud. 


-----------------------------------------------

### ***AWS S3***

- `Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)` is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. 
- This means customers of all sizes and industries can use it to store and protect any amount of data for a range of use cases, such as `data lakes, websites, mobile applications, backup and restore, archive, enterprise applications, IoT devices, and big data analytics`.


### ***AWS Lambda Basics***

- `AWS Lambda` is a serverless computing service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). 
- Users of `AWS Lambda` create functions, self-contained applications written in one of the supported languages and runtimes, and upload them to AWS Lambda, which executes those functions in an efficient and flexible manner.


### ***CDN***

- `Content Delivery Network (CDN)` is a geographically distributed group of servers that work together to provide fast delivery of Internet content. 
- A `CDN` allows for the fast transfer of data needed for loading Internet content including `HTML pages, javascript files, stylesheets, images, and videos`.
