4. Ember.js
5.  jQuery

### ***What’s the difference between a framework and a library?***

- A `library` performs specific, well-defined operations.

- A `framework` is a skeleton where the application defines the `meat` of the operation by filling out the skeleton. The skeleton still has code to link up the parts but the most important work is done by the application.

>Examples of libraries: `Network protocols, compression, image manipulation, string utilities, regular expression evaluation, math. Operations are self-contained`.

>Examples of frameworks: `Web application system, Plug-in manager, GUI system. The framework defines the concept but the application defines the fundamental functionality that end-users care about`.
