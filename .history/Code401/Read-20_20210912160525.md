## **Component Based UI**

### ***Name 5 Javascript UI Frameworks (other than React)***

1. Node.js
2. Vue.js
3. AngularJS
4. Ember.js
5.  jQuery

### ***What’s the difference between a framework and a library?***

- A `library` performs specific, well-defined operations.

- A `framework` is a skeleton where the application defines the `meat` of the operation by filling out the skeleton. The skeleton still has code to link up the parts but the most important work is done by the application.

>Examples of libraries: `Network protocols, compression, image manipulation, string utilities, regular expression evaluation, math. Operations are self-contained`.

>Examples of frameworks: `Web application system, Plug-in manager, GUI system. The framework defines the concept but the application defines the fundamental functionality that end-users care about`.

## **Terms**

- **Rendering**: Rendering refers to showing the output in the browser

- **Templates**: `template` is a chunk of HTML that you need to inject onto the page. Often templates are created `server side` – in that they come to the JavaScript fully formed and just need to be put into the DOM. 

- **State**: State is a plain JavaScript object used by React to represent an information about the component's current situation.
