## **useState() Hook**

### ***How does React differ from vanilla JS/HTML/CSS?***

- `React` breaks down the UI into smaller and reusable components that can move around data amongst each other. This breaking down of the UI is what gives React an edge over `Vanilla JS`.

### ***What is the primary difference between a function component and a class component?***

-  **Functional Components:**
     1. A `functional component` is just a plain `JavaScript` function that accepts props as an argument and returns a `React element`.
     2. There is no render method used in functional components.
     3. Also known as `Stateless` components as they simply accept data and display them in some form, that they are mainly responsible for rendering UI
      4. `React` lifecycle methods `for example, componentDidMount` cannot be used in functional components.

- **Class Components:**
     1. A `class component` requires you to extend from `React`. Component and create a render function which returns a `React element`.
     2. It must have the `render()` method returning `HTML`
     3. Also known as `Stateful` components because they implement logic and state.
     4. `React` lifecycle methods can be used inside class components `for example, componentDidMount`.

## **Terms**

- **Functional Components**: Functional components are some of the more common components that will come across while working in React. These are simply JavaScript functions. We can create a functional component to React by writing a JavaScript function.

- **Class Component**: This is the bread and butter of most modern web apps built in ReactJS. These components are simple classes (made up of multiple functions that add functionality to the application).

- **Children / Child Components**: is a special property of `React` components which contains any child elements defined within the component.
