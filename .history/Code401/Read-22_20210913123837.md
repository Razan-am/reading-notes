## **Component Lifecycle / useEffect()**

### ***Why do we not need more .html pages in a multi-page React app?***

- Because `React app` consists of a single `HTML file index.html`. The views are coded in JSX format as components.And when we need to build multi-page websites in `React` we use multiple routes instead of multiple pages to handle multiple views.

### ***If we wanted a component to show up on every page, where would we put it and why?***
   - Inside a `<Route />`, so we can access it 

### ***What does routing do with the components that were rendered when a new route is requested***

- Routing is the process through which the user is navigated to different pages on a website. Rendering is the process of putting those pages on the UI. Every time you request a route to a particular page, you are also rendering that page, but not every render is an outcome of a route.`So the URL bar changes and a different view is rendered on the page`

### ***What does props.children contain?***

-  can have one element, multiple elements, or none at all, its value is respectively a single child node, an array of child nodes or undefined

>This component contains an html tag that is receiving some props and then it is displaying `{props.children}`.

>Whenever this component is invoked `{props.children}` will also be displayed and this is just a reference to what is between the opening and closing tags of the component.

### ***How do `useState()` and `this.setState()` differ?***

- `setState() Class Component`
    - Using `state` in a class component requires the building of a state object. This state object is then modified by calling `this.setState("new state")`.

- `useState() Functional Component`
    - With a functional component, we can use React hooks, specifically the `useState() hook`. This simplifies the creation of a state component and the function that updates it.

-----------------------------------------------


## **Terms**

- **State Hook**:  Hook is a special function that lets you “hook into” React features. For example, useState is a Hook that lets you add React state to function components.

- **Mounting and Un-Mounting**:
    - `Mounting` a file system attaches that file system to a directory (mount point) and makes it available to the system. The root (/) file system is always mounted. Any other file system can be connected or disconnected from the root (/) file system.
    - These files are not permanently affected by the mounting process, and they become available again when the file system is `unmounted`.
