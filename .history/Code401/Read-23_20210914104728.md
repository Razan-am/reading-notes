## **Advanced State with Reducers**

### ***How can we ensure that an effect hook runs only once?***

- If you only want to run the function given to `useEffect` after the initial render, you can give it an `empty array` as second argument.

### ***Can useState() update more than one state variable at the same time?***

- Unlike the `setState` in class components, the setState returned from `useState` doesn't merge objects with existing state, it replaces the object entirely. If you want to do a merge, you would need to read the previous state and merge it with the new values yourself.

### ***Is useState() synchronous?***

- `useState and setState both are asynchronous`.
    - They do not update the state immediately but have queues that are used to update the state object. This is done to improve the performance of the rendering of React components.

## **Terms**

- **State Hook**: Hook is a special function that lets you “hook into” React features. For example, useState is a Hook that lets you add React state to function components.

- **Component Lifecycle**: Components are created (mounted on the DOM), grow by updating, and then die (unmount on DOM). This is referred to as a component lifecycle.There are different lifecycle methods that React provides at different phases of a component’s life.
