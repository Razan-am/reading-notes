## **Context API**


### ***Describe use cases useState() vs useReducer()***

 - Although `useState` is a Basic Hook for managing simple state transformation and `useReducer` is an Additional Hook for managing more complex state logic, it is worth noting that `useState` uses the `useReducer` internally. This implies that you could use `useReducer` for everything you can do with `useState`.
 - `useReducer` lets you avoid passing down callbacks through different levels of your component, instead allowing you to pass a provided dispatch function, which in turn will improve performance for components that trigger deep updates.And this does not imply that the `useState` updater function.

### ***Why do custom hooks need the use prefix?***

- Custom hooks are normal JS functions, named with the prefix `use`, that can use hooks inside of it and contain a common stateful logic to be reused in other components.

### ***What do custom hooks usually do?***

- Custom hooks allow us to have cleaner functional components, remove logic from the UI layer, and prevent code duplication by bringing common use cases to reusable hooks.

### ***Using any list of custom hooks, research and name one that you think will be useful in your applications***

- **react-use-form-state hook:**
   - Forms are everywhere, even in the smallest of applications we have to encounter forms and manage their state. Managing form state in React can be a bit unwieldy sometimes.

   - `react-use-form-state` is a small React Hook that attempts to simplify managing form state, using the native form input elements you are familiar with.

  -  Installation:
     - `npm i react-use-form-state`

  - Usage:

![useForm](../images/useForm.PNG)

### ***Describe how a hook that fetches API data might work***

1. Import useEffect
  - `import React, { useEffect } from "react"`
2. Then, define your useEffect hook inside of your component.
import React, { useEffect } from "react";

        const App = () => {
            
            useEffect(() => {

            }, []);

            return <div></div>;
        };

       export default App;


3. Define your URL

        useEffect(() => {

            const url = "https://api.adviceslip.com/advice"
            
        }, []);

4.Create the asynchronous function

    const fetchData = async () => {

        try {
            const response = await fetch(url);
            const json = await response.json();
            console.log(json);
            } catch (error) {
            console.log("error", error);
            }
    };

5. Put the fetchData function above in the useEffect hook and call it, like so:

        useEffect(() => {
            const url = "https://api.adviceslip.com/advice";

            const fetchData = async () => {
            try {
                const response = await fetch(url);
                const json = await response.json();
                console.log(json);
            } catch (error) {
                console.log("error", error);
            }
            };

            fetchData();
        }, []);

>The function we just created is wrapped in a try...catch statement so that the function catches the errors and prints them in the console. This helps debug and prevents the app to crash unexpectedly.

-----------------------------------------------


## **Terms**

- **reducer** : `reducer` is a function that determines changes to an application's `state`. It uses the action it receives to determine this change. We have tools, like Redux, that help manage an application's state changes in a single store so that they behave consistently.

-----------------------------------------------

### ***context api***

- Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.
