## **Context API - Behaviors**


### ***When you have multiple contexts, what component type should you use (class/function) and why?***

- Function component is more effecience and less complexity that the class component to deal with multiple contexts

### ***What are some good use cases for using the Context API for global state?***

- Like to use it to filter some specific data so to put it simply, global state is the data that is shared between all the components within a React application. When the state is changed, or letâ€™s say a filter is added, the components re-render accordingly. 

### ***How can you best test context?***

- A good way to start testing in my opinion is to test that the different states of your component are showing as expected. Seems pretty easy. And mocking props in jest/enzyme is easy. However when you start adding Redux, Api calls and Context it becomes a different story.
