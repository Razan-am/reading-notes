## **Context API - Behaviors**


### ***When you have multiple contexts, what component type should you use (class/function) and why?***

- Function component is more effecience and less complexity that the class component to deal with multiple contexts

### ***What are some good use cases for using the Context API for global state?***

- Like to use it to filter some specific data so to put it simply, global state is the data that is shared between all the components within a React application. When the state is changed, or let’s say a filter is added, the components re-render accordingly. 

### ***How can you best test context?***

- A good way to start testing in my opinion is to test that the different states of your component are showing as expected. Seems pretty easy. And mocking props in jest/enzyme is easy. However when you start adding Redux, Api calls and Context it becomes a different story.

## **Terms**

- **context**: React Context is a method to pass props from parent to child component(s), by storing the props in a store(similar in Redux) and using these props from the store by child component(s) without actually passing them manually at each level of the component tree.

- **useContext()**: “useContext” hook is used to create common data that can be accessed throughout the component hierarchy without passing the props down manually to each level.

- **static context**: a collection of methods that stand up a static store which can be accessed via HOC or plain object reference. In this way the store is reduced to a basic state/setState api which is familiar to react developers.
