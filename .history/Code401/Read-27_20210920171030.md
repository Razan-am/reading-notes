## **Context API - Behaviors**


### ***Why is the Context API useful?***

- Because it's enables you to exchange unique details and assists in solving prop-drilling from all levels of your application.

### ***Can a component outside of a provider get its context?***

- Yes we can call useContext in each component to pull out the values we need. It doesn’t matter how far apart the components are as long as they’re wrapped in a provider.

### ***What are some common use cases for using the Context API?***

- Some sample use cases where the Context API proves helpful are:

   - Theming — Pass down app themei
   - 18n — Pass down translation messages
   - Authentication — Pass down current authenticated user

### ***Describe “Context Hell”***

- How to fix it?
  - To clean up the nasty code you get from taking advantage of React Context API we need a way to nest multiple Context.Provider without passing them as children of each other.

  - To achieve that we can use the React.cloneElement API.

  - The cloneElement API
