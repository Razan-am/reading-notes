## **API Integration**

### ***How do bearer tokens work?***

- `Bearer Token` A security token with the property that any party in possession of the token (a `bearer`) can use the token in any way that any other party in possession of it can. Using a bearer token does not require a bearer to prove possession of cryptographic key material (proof-of-possession).

### ***Describe express middleware***

- `Express middleware` are functions that execute during the lifecycle of a request to the Express server. Each middleware has access to the HTTP `request` and `response` for each route (or path) itâ€™s attached to.
- This `chaining` of middleware allows you to compartmentalize your code and create reusable middleware.

### ***What is a JWT?***

- `JSON Web Token (JWT)` is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA.
