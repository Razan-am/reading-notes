## **Redux - Combined Reducers**

### ***Why choose Redux instead of the Context API for global state?***

- **Context API:** Resourceful and ideal for small applications where state changes are minimal
- **Redux:** Perfect for larger applications where there are high-frequency state updates
- `Context API` is easy to is use as it has a short learning curve. It requires less code, and because there's no need of extra libraries, bundle sizes are reduced. `Redux` on the other hand requires adding more libraries to the application bundle. The syntax is complex and extensive creating unnecessary work and complexity.


### ***What is the purpose of a reducer?***

- A `reducer` is a function that determines changes to an application’s state. It uses the action it receives to determine this change. We have tools, like `Redux`, that help manage an application’s state changes in a single store so that they behave consistently.

### ***What does an action contain?***

- `Actions` are the only source of information for the store as per `Redux` official documentation. It carries a `payload` of information from your application to store.

### ***Why do we need to copy the state in a reducer?***


- `redux` only requires our reducers to stay pure. If the new `state` is different, the `reducer must create new object, and making a copy is a way to describe the unchanged part.
