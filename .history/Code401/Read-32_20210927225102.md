## **Redux - Combined Reducers**

### ***How granular should your reducers be?***

- A Redux app really only has one reducer function: the "root reducer" function that you will pass to createStore later on. That one root reducer function is responsible for handling all of the actions that are dispatched, and calculating what the entire new state result should be every time.

### ***Pro or Con – multiple reducers can “fire” when a commonly named action is dispatched***
 
- Pro, Since the state of a complex app could be really wide, there is not a single reducer, but many reducers for any kind of action.

### ***Name a strategy for preventing the above***

- Make a reducer for each component that will be affected by the dispatcher, only effecting a specific amount of the state it self.
