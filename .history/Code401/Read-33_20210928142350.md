## **Redux - Additional Topics**

### ***What’s the best practice for “pre-loading” data into the store (on application start) in a Redux application?***

- The most 'redux-like' way of handling the pre-loading of data would be to fire off the asynchronous action in the lifecycle method (probably componentWillMount) of a Higher Order Component that wraps your app.

### ***When using a thunk/async action that dispatches the actual action, which do you export from your reducer?***

- You export the actions that follow the lifecycle of a request to an external API.
