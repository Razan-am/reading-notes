## **Redux - Additional Topics**

### ***What’s the best practice for “pre-loading” data into the store (on application start) in a Redux application?***

- The most 'redux-like' way of handling the pre-loading of data would be to fire off the asynchronous action in the lifecycle method (probably componentWillMount) of a Higher Order Component that wraps your app.

### ***When using a thunk/async action that dispatches the actual action, which do you export from your reducer?***

- You export the actions that follow the lifecycle of a request to an external API.


-------------------------------------------------------------


## **Terms**

- **middleware**: Redux middleware provides a third-party extension point between dispatching an action, and the moment it reaches the reducer. People use Redux middleware for logging, crash reporting, talking to an asynchronous API, routing, and more.

- **thunk**: Redux Thunk is a middleware that allows you to call the action creators that return a function(thunk) which takes the store's dispatch method as the argument and which is afterwards used to dispatch the synchronous action after the API or side effects has been finished.

-----------------------------------------------

### ***Redux Toolkit (RTK)***

- The Redux Toolkit package is intended to be the standard way to write Redux logic. It was originally created to help address three common concerns about Redux:

   - "Configuring a Redux store is too complicated"
   - "I have to add a lot of packages to get Redux to do anything useful"
   - "Redux requires too much boilerplate code"
