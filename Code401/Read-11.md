## **Event Driven Applications**

### ***Why is access control important?***

- Because `access controls` limit access to information and information processing systems. When implemented effectively, they mitigate the risk of information being accessed without the appropriate authorisation, unlawfully and the risk of a data breach. 

### ***Describe an application that would need access control.What is a role used for?***

- Role-based access control `RBAC`, also known as role-based security, is a mechanism that restricts system access. It involves setting permissions and privileges to enable access to authorized users.
- Most large organizations use role-based access control to provide their employees with varying levels of access based on their roles and responsibilities.
- This protects sensitive data and ensures employees can only access information and perform actions they need to do their jobs.

### ***Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?***

- Access control measures regulate who can view or use resources in a computing system, often relying on authentication or authorization based on log-in credentials. They are essential to minimizing business risks. Access control systems can be physical, limiting access to buildings, rooms, or servers, or they can be logical, controlling digital access to data, files, or networks.

## **Terms**

1. **Authorization**: it's a security mechanism to determine access levels or user/client privileges related to system resources including files, services, computer programs, data and application features.

2. **Role Based Access Control**: `Role-based access control (RBAC)` restricts network access based on a person's role within an organization and has become one of the main methods for advanced access control. The roles in RBAC refer to the levels of access that employees have to the network.

3. **Capabilities**: is the set of tasks or activities that a business function of an organization is potentially able to perform `acquired skills` at a certain level of performance available capacity, but only when it is needed
