## **Socket.io**

### ***What Socket.IO is***

- `Socket.IO` is a library that enables real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication between `the browser and the server`. It consists of:

   1. a Node.js server: Source|API
   2. a Javascript client library for the browser (which can be also run from Node.js): Source|API

### ***What is the benefit of transforming data into packets?***

- `TDM`-based networks must transform into `packet-based networks` to meet the demands of pervasive data-centric applications and services.

- `Packet-based` networks not only enable `new innovations, services, and business opportunities`, they are also the most `cost-effective, efficient, and scalable networks` for content delivery.

### ***UDP is often refereed to as a connectionless protocol. Why is this?***

- Because it is analogous to sending a letter where you don't acknowledge receipt.

### ***Can a socket server application have multiple socket connections?***

- Yes, Multiple connections on the same server can share the same `server-side IP/Port` pair as long as they are associated with different `client-side IP/Port` pairs, and the server would be able to handle as many clients as available system resources allow it to.

### ***Can a socket connection application be connected to multiple socket servers?***

-  No,a server socket listens on a single port. All established client connections on that server are associated with that same listening port on the server side of the connection.

### ***Can an application be both a socket server and a socket connection?***

- No, You can not combine server and client sockets into one, because a TCP/IP connection goes from a source port to a destination port, with each having unique port numbers.

## **Terms**

- **Observer Pattern**: is a `software design pattern` in which an `object`, named the `subject`, maintains a list of its `dependents`, called `observers`, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.

- **Listener**: It is a JavaScript function which respond to the event occur.

- **Event Handler**: which is a block of code usually a JavaScript function that you as a programmer create that runs when the event fires.

- **Event Driven Programming**:  is a programming paradigm in which the flow of the program is determined by events such as user actions `mouse clicks, key presses`, sensor outputs, or message passing from other programs or threads. 

- **Event Loop**: is the secret behind JavaScript???s asynchronous programming. JS executes all operations on a single thread, but using a few smart data structures, it gives us the illusion of multi-threading.

- **Event Queue**: is responsible for sending new functions to the track for processing. It follows the queue data structure to maintain the correct sequence in which all operations should be sent for execution.

- **Call Stack**: is responsible for keeping track of all the operations in line to be executed. Whenever a function is finished, it is popped from the stack.

- **Emit/Raise/Trigger**: method is used to trigger the event.

- **Subscribe**: The .subscribe() function is similar to the Promise.then(), .catch() and .finally() methods, but instead of dealing with promises it deals with Observables.

- **database**:  it's implements a common, promise-based interface for SQL database access. Inspired by Java, it uses connection strings to identify the database driver. Wrappers around native database drivers provide a unified interface to handle databases
