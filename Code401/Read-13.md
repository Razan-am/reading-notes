## **Message Queues**

### ***What does it mean that web sockets are bidirectional? Why is this useful?***

- WebSockets allow for full-duplex bidirectional communication, this enables the server to send real-time updates asynchronously, without requiring the client to submit a request each time. Yes it's useful.

### ***Does socket.io use HTTP? Why?***

- Yes it's use it but it doesn't need an HTTP server to regular websockets,but it is used to allow HTTP and websocket servers to co-exist on the same TCP port.

### ***What happens when a client emits an event?***

- The event gets passed to the server through websockets. Its a tcp connection from the client to the server. The connection meaning the server can send real time data to the client and vise versa.

### ***What happens when a server emits an event?***

- It will send an event called message to the client, after the client connects. The send function on socket object associates the 'message' event.

### ***What happens if a client “misses” an event?***

- The events will be ignored 

### ***How can we mitigate this?***
 
- You could avoid missing messages by always having the handlers  and then deciding in the handlers whether to do anything with the message or not.


### ***Sockets work based on events. There are some reserved events, which can be accessed using the socket object on the server side.These are :***

1. Connect
2. Message
3. Disconnect
4. Reconnect
5. Ping
6. Join and
7. Leave.

### ***The client-side socket object also provides us with some reserved events, which are :***

1. Connect
2. Connect_error
3. Connect_timeout
4. Reconnect, etc.

## **Terms**

- **Socket**: it was created to use open connections to facilitate realtime communication, still a relatively new phenomenon at the time. 

- **Web Socket**:  it is an advanced technology that makes it possible to open a two-way interactive communication session between the user's browser and a server.

- **Socket.io**: it is a library that enables real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication between the browser and the server.

- **Client**: a computer hardware device or software that accesses a service made available by a server.

- **Server**: is a physical computer dedicated to run services to serve the needs of other computers. Depending on the service that is running, it could be a file server, database server, home media server, print server, or web server.

- **OSI Model**: `The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI)` model describes seven layers that computer systems use to communicate over a network.

- **TCP Model**:  `TCP` model defines how devices should transmit data between them and enables communication over networks and large distances. The model represents how data is exchanged and organized over networks.

- **TCP**: `TCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol` a communications standard that enables application programs and computing devices to exchange messages over a network. 

- **UDP**: `User Datagram Protocol, or UDP,` is a communication protocol used across the Internet for especially time-sensitive transmissions such as video playback or DNS lookups.

- **Packets**: it is a small segment of a larger message.
