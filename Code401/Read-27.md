## **`<Login />` and `<Auth />`**


### ***Why is the Context API useful?***

- Because it's enables you to exchange unique details and assists in solving prop-drilling from all levels of your application.

### ***Can a component outside of a provider get its context?***

- Yes we can call useContext in each component to pull out the values we need. It doesn’t matter how far apart the components are as long as they’re wrapped in a provider.

### ***What are some common use cases for using the Context API?***

- Some sample use cases where the Context API proves helpful are:

   - Theming — Pass down app themei
   - 18n — Pass down translation messages
   - Authentication — Pass down current authenticated user

### ***Describe “Context Hell”***

- the React Context hell is the nasty code you get taking advantage of the React Context API.

- How to fix it?
  - To clean up the nasty code you get from taking advantage of React Context API we need a way to nest multiple Context.Provider without passing them as children of each other.

  - To achieve that we can use the React.cloneElement API.

  - The cloneElement API

## **Terms**

- **global state**:  a global state is a set of local states which are all concurrent with each other

- **global context**: it's designed to share data that can be considered “global” for a tree of React components, such as the current authenticated user, theme, or preferred language. 

- **provider**:  Provider React component that allows consuming components to subscribe to context changes.
 
- **consumer**: A React component that subscribes to context changes. Using this component lets you subscribe to a context within a function component

### ***what is role based access control?***

- `Role-based access control (RBAC)` restricts network access based on a person's `role` within an organization and has become one of the main methods for advanced access control.

- Some of the designations in an RBAC tool can include:

  - Management role scope – it limits what objects the role group is allowed to manage.
  - Management role group – you can add and remove members.
  - Management role – these are the types of tasks that can be performed by a specific role group.
  - Management role assignment – this links a role to a role group.


### ***react-cookies component***

- Cookies are the data stored in the form of key-value pairs that are used to store information about the user on their computer by the websites that the users browse and use it to verify them.

- To set or remove the cookies, we are going to use a third-party dependency of react-cookie.
