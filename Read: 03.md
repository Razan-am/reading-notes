### So an overall the websites are being built using HTML and CSS,so how these worked ?

+ HTML pages are text documents.
+ HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled brackets) to give the information they surround special meaning.
+ Tags are often referred to as elements.
+ Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes
the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes
the end.
+ Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more
about the content of that element.
+ Attributes require a name and a value.
+ To learn HTML you need to know what tags are
available for you to use, what they do, and where they
can go.
