# ***Computers***

------------------------------------------------------------
- When we say computer what we mean it is not just a pc or just a laptop. Computer are about everything we use nowadays whether it's our smartphones , tablets ,VR,smart watches....etc, and so many other examples.So computers it's a thinking machine that we built it to helps us in manipulate information.

### **Now what is make a computer a computer?**

- All computers must perform 4 tasks :
1. Take input 
2. Store information
3. processing
4. Output the result 

>And with these 4 things what make a computer a computer.

1. **input:**

**```It's basiclly about the orders that the computer receive it from the user that make it do these orders .
These orders comes in many different ways it could be with the mouse, key boards, camera,microphone , through the touch of your finger in the secreen ....etc.```**

2. **Storage :**

**```All the inputs will be giving the computer informations and the computer will store it in memory .```**

3. **Processing :**

**```The computer processer will take these stored information then it will manipulates or changes it with ALGORITHM which is a series of commands after that these processed information will be send back to be stored again in the memory so it will be ready to be output.```**

4. **Output :**

**```The output is different depending on what is the computer been designed to.```**
   - Computer disply : shows text,photos,videos,and virtual  reality.
  - Computer with a signals output used to control robots.

>And when the Computers are connected to the internet the 
output from one computer it'll be the input for the another and vice versa.

#### As time pass computers have been developed alot from only being as only a basic calculatore to be able to talk with each others and use them to play games , control robots ,but  they all always do the same for things .

### **How Computers Work**

- Computers worked in the inside in `binary number system` and basically it's represented by `ones and zeros`.The computers from the inside are an electric wires and circuites that carry all the informations inside the computer.So to store these information using the electricity, we need to know that these ones and zeros are been represented with in one wire and its called bit, as many wires we have inside the computers as many bits we have as many zeros and ones we have.
>These ones and zeroes technically they are representing all the information we input inside the computer and also all the output.

**Now how everything are converting to the binary system?**

- Everything can be represented in binary system by converting it to ones and zeros  

1. **Decimal numbers :**

2. **Text in binary system :**

3. **Image and videos in binary system :**
all the images are made of very small dots called pixels,and each pixel has a color, and each color can be represented with a number.

------------------------------------------------------------

>Programmers when they are using the computer to write a code or buillt an app, they are not directly dealing with these ones and zeros,but they are dealing with  images and videos and sounds that they are converting to the binary system.

----------------------------------------------------------

### **Hardware and Software**

- **Hardware** are the what you can see inside your device such as the ships,wires,circuits,plugs,speakers,and all these kind of stuff.

- **Software** its all the codes and the programs that are running on this device  such as games,maps,apps,web pages.

**Then how the software and the hard ware are iteracting with each other ?**

- **The hardware** has a device called central processing unit `CPU`.The CPU it's a ship that controls all the part of the device. The CPU in charge to do diffrent things so it has inside it acircuits with a small parts that each one of them handel specific tasks.
>Such as one of them is responsible to send and recieve information to and from different parts of the device.And another one is responsible in do a math and logic parts.


**How CPU work ?**

- The CPU recieve a command that tell it wich circuit to use to a specific job.
For example :
  - ADD command 
  - Move command
  - Store command 


- **The software :**
In the CPU all the commands are been saved in binary system and its a software laguage, so to write a command such as draw a circle on the screen programmers will used a programming language such as python , html ...., tat will be converting to binary commands that CPU will understand it .


>All  this process runs with an operation system, this system is the master programm of the device that manage how the software gets to use the hardeware of the device.
Such as  :
- Windows
- Andriod OS
- IOS
