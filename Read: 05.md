# **JAVASCRIPT**

### **Decisions and loops**

- Creating and controlling the flow of data in your scripts  `(Codes)` to handle different situations,making the browser be able to runs different code in different situations.

- Scripts often need to behave differently depending upon how the user interacts with the web page and/or the browser window itself. To determine which path to take, programmers often rely upon the following three concepts: 

1. **EVALUATIONS :**You can analyze values in your scripts to determine whether or note they match expected results. 


2. **DECISIONS :**The results from evaluations you can decide which path your script should go down.


3. **LOOPS :**There are also many occasions where you will want to perform the same set of steps repeatedly

#### **Decisions making**
In the script there is sveral places in charge in determine wich line of code should run next.

>For examples :
There is decesion that must be made so the code can take one of the different pathes and each one of these pathes are made of set of tasks.Thats means for each situation you have to write different code.
In order to determine wich path to take you'll set a condition and depending on the result the path will be choosen.



#### **Comparison operators:**

there are two componant to decision :

1. **Evaluating condition:** an expression is evaluated which is returns avalue .

2. **Conditional statments:** aconditional statment says what to do in agiven situation

#### **Evaluating condition**
- You can evaluate a situation by comapring one value in the script to what you expect it might be .

- The result in the boolean will be eather true or false , using a comparison operators such as :
  - Greater than (>):checks if the number on the left is greater than the number on the right 

  - Less than (<):checks if the number on the left is less than the number on the right

  - Greater than or equal to (>=) :checks if the number on the left is greater than or equal to the number on the right.

  - Less than or equal to (<=):checks if the number on the left is less than or equal to the number on the right.

  - Equal to ( == ):the operator compare two values (numbers, strings,boolean) to see if they are the same .

  - Not equal to (!=):the operator compare two values (numbers, strings,boolean) to see if they are not the same .

  - Strict equal to (===):the operator compare two values to check if that both the datatype and the value are the same. 

  - Strict not equal to (!===):the operator compare two values to check if that both the datatype and the value are not the same.

#### **Logical operators:**
Comparision operators returns a single value (True or false),the logical operators allows you to compare the result of more than one comparision operator .
