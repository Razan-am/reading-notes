# **JAVASCRIPT**

### **Introduction** 

- Javascripts can be used in browsers to make website more interactive by respounding to whta the user does, interesting, and user-friendly `by :`

1. **ACCESS CONTENT :**You can use JavaScript to select any
element, attribute, or text from an HTML page.
  * Select the text inside all of the <hl>elements on a page
  + Select any elements that have a class attribute with a value of note
  * Find out what was entered into a text input whose id attribute has a value of email
2. **MODIFY CONTENT:**You can use JavaScript to add
elements, attributes, and text to the page, or remove them.
  - Add a paragraph of text after the first <hl> element
  - Change the value of class attributes to trigger new CSS rules
3. **PROGRAM RULES:**You can specify a set of steps for
the browser to follow (like a recipe),which allows it to access or change the content of a page.
   -  A gallery script could check which image a user clicked on and display a larger version of that image. 



4. **REACT TO EVENTS:**You can specify that a script should run when a specific event has occurrede, it could be run when:
   - A button is pressed
   - A link is clicked (or tapped) on
   - A cursor hovers over an element

#### **JAVASCRIPT IN THE BROWSER**
- Access the content of the page
- Modify the content of the page
- Program rules or instructions the browser can follow
- React to events triggered by the user or browser

**```Before you learn how to read and write the JavaScript
language itself, you need to become familiar with some key
concepts in computer programming and they are :```**

***1. What is a script and how do I create one?*** 
   - A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow step by step to achieve a goal. `Sicript could be :`
       - RECIPES
       - HANDBOOKS
       - MANUALS

>A browser may use different parts of the script depending on how the user interacts with the web page.
>Script can run different sections of the code in response to the situation around them.

##### WRITING A SCRIPT
- To write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the
tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it. 

- Start with the big picture of what you want to achieve, and break
that down into following steps :
    1. DEFINE THE GOAL :First, you need to define the task you want to achieve. You can think of this as a puzzle for the computer to solve. 
    2. DESIGN THE SCRIPT : To design a script you split the goal out into a series of tasks that are going to be involved in solving this puzzle.
    3. CODE EACH STEP : Each of the steps needs to be written in a programming language that the computer understands. In our case, this is JavaScript.

##### FROM STEPS TO CODE
- Every step for every task shown in a flowchart needs to be written
in a language the computer can understand and follow.`You should focus in :`

  - You need to get to work with the:
    • Vocabulary: The words that computers understand
    • Syntax: How you put those words together to create instructions computers can follow

  - You need to learn to "think" like a computer because they solve
tasks in different ways than you or I might approach them. 

>So To approach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task (a flowchart can help).
